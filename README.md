# CSC 1120 Final Exam - Tanks

## Finish this game and make it your own!

In this repo, you'll find (a Windows version) of the tanks game we started in class.

You have learned about GitHub now so these are the files you'll FORK. 
If you clone, like we did in class, you'll still be connected to this repo. 
If you fork, you are downloading your own unique copy.

# Instructions

1. Finish this game. See below.
2. Make it your own. You can change any aspect of this code and game as long as it continues to play the "same game." 

    For example, I really don't like the keys I chose for up and down - do you? If you don't, pick different ones.
    *Note: do not assume my code is correct - discovering any deficiencies is a learning objective.*

Go crazy or play it safe - it's up to you.

3. All your changes will be mainted on GitHub.
4. Your GitHub must have a lovely README.md.
5. You must work with a partner. No solo efforts because working with a partner via GitHub is one of the learning objectives.
6. On 5/9 and 5/11, you and your partner will connect to the projector at the front of the room and present your work for 10 to 15 minutes.
Order of presentations will be chosen at random. Please DO NOT MAKE CHANGES after the start of class on 5/9 - remember GitHub remembers 
all the dates and times.
If you are uncomfortable speaking, that's OK - it is your responsibility to choose a partner who can speak in front of the class.
7. You will:
<pre>
    Demonstrate your game. Make sure you show how you customized it.
    Show your GitHub page, including evidence of collaboration and the README.
    Show specific parts of your code you are proud of.
</pre>
8. Then you and your partner will leave the room,
9. The class will discuss your work and assign a grade from 0 to 100. If extra credit should be awarded, it can be at most 20 points.
10. I reserve the right to override the decision of the community. I will not reveal the grade actually awarded.

# Finishing

Your finished project must include the following:
1. Detecting a hit on your opponent. A hit is defined as the shot passing through any of the 9 spots surrounding the opposing player.
2. Implement a scoring system. When a player hits the other three time, use curses to ask the user if they want to continue, yes or no.
3. After each hit, the player and the ground must be chosen over again.
4. An additional 20 points is up to you.

# What if you have already finished the game?

Some of you took it upon yourselves to finish the game based on our classwork. Make sure you conform to all aspects of this
specification then choose a very lucky partner. Decide on extra credit and have them to the heavier lifting.
